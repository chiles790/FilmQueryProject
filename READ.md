## Film Query Project
### My program
This program allows a user to pull data from the film portion of our database and see a print out of info about actors and films. The program starts by asking the user to select in what way they wanted to search for films. Either by searching using an ID and seeing the info for that movie or by searching using a keyword and seeing all movies that contain the keyword.

### Skills I put to use
* MYSQL
* Maven
* Java
* Atom
* Eclipse

### How to use
1. In my github repository, clone the 5 provided classes.
2. Run FilmQueryapp, which will prompt you with a looping menu with the option to search with ID, or keyword search.
3. When you are finished using the program, you can easily exit the program with the Exit option in the menu.
